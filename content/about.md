Hi, I'm Hadley. I work as a data center technician. Occasionally, I sell used books under the name Book Disorder. This site is a growing collection of my thoughts, projects and experiments. You'll find stuff about my homelab and other tech I tinker with, outdoor adventures, and   books - particularly vintage guides on environmentalism and self-sufficiency.
