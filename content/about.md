Hi, I'm Hadley. I work as a data center technician. Occasionally, I sell used books under the name Book Disorder. I'm interested in canoe trips and old books. This site is a work in progress intended to document my projects and experiments. Expect writing about my homelab (currently HP Mini's in a Proxmox cluster) and other tech I use, outdoor recreation, and books (especially vintage texts about environmentalism and self-sufficiency).
